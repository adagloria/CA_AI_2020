    "# Build an API in Python (with Flask & RapidAPI)\n",
    "____________\n",
    "This notebook present all the steps that should be carried out in order to create an API using Python with Flask & RapidAPI. Most of the content was adopted from [this amazing tutorial](https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-build-an-api-in-python/), this is just a summarized interactive version of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this seems not enough, you may find another 20 tutorials [here](https://rapidapi.com/blog/20-tutorials-on-how-to-create-your-own-api-sorted-by-programming-language/).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Note` For more information about what an API is, check [this RapidAPI explanation](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/api/)\n",
    "____________\n",
    "## `Requirements`\n",
    "To create this API, we will use Python and:\n",
    "- Python 3 (obviously)\n",
    "- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) – a simple and easy-to-use framework for creating web applications. \n",
    "- [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - an extension for Flask which enables rapid development of REST API with minimal setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install these packages, activate your preferred conda environment, and these lines within the terminal (you may also install these packages via `pip` if you don't use `conda`, just google `pip install package_name`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c anaconda flask \n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge flask-restful \n",
    "____________\n",
    "## Before we begin...\n",
    "We will develop a `RESTful API` that implements the basic CRUD functionality.\n",
    "____________\n",
    "### [*REST*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\n",
    "REST API is an API that uses [HTTP requests](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/http-request-methods/) for communication. It must follow these constraints:\n",
    "- ***Client-server architecture*** – the client handles the user interface, and the server handles the backend and data storage. Client and server are independent, and each of them can be replaced separately.\n",
    "- ***Stateless*** – no data from the client is stored on the server-side. The session state is stored on the client-side.\n",
    "- ***Cacheable*** – clients can cache server responses to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [*CRUD*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)\n",
    "A programming concept that identifies 4 basic actions (create, read, update, and delete) that can be performed on the data. In the REST API, `Types of Requests` or `Request Methods` are responsible for these actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`POST`](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/post/): Create action. Adds new data to the server. Using this type of request, we can, for example, add a new post to a blog.\n",
    "- [`GET`](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/get/): Read action. Retrieve information. This is the most common type of request. Using it we can, for example, get a list of blog posts.\n",
    "- `PUT`: Update action. Changes existing information. For example, using this type of request, it would be possible to change the text of the existing article.\n",
    "- `DELETE`: Delete action. Deletes existing information, such as a blog post, that we are no longer interested in.\n",
